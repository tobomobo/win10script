# win10script
This is the Ultimate Windows 10 Script from a creation from multiple debloat scripts and gists from github. It's the right fit for me, but if it isn't for you, go ahead and fork the repo and change whatever you want. Have a nice day ;)

## My Additions

-added various Prgoramms to the script
-changed security settings to my own liking, such as: 
	-turned on windows defender 
	-turned on defender cloud
-turned on indexing
-changed various ui settings to my linking, such as:
	-small taskbar icons
	-taskbar combined when full
